# Plugin API Documentation

This document describes the plugin API for interacting with Timeful events.
Plugins can retrieve and update user availability through `get-slots` and `set-slots` methods.

## Overview

Plugins communicate with the Timeful frontend via `window.postMessage`.
The frontend validates incoming messages and routes them to the appropriate handler method.
Responses are sent back using the same mechanism.

## Message Handler

The `handleMessage` method validates incoming messages and routes them to the appropriate handler:

- Messages with `payload.type === "get-slots"` are routed to `getSlots()`
- Messages with `payload.type === "set-slots"` are routed to `setSlots()`

## Request Format

All plugin API requests must follow this format:

```javascript
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "unique-request-id", // Used to match requests with responses
    payload: {
      type: "get-slots" | "set-slots",
      // ... additional payload fields (see below)
    },
  },
  "*",
)
```

## get-slots

### Description

Retrieves availability slots for all respondents to an event.
Returns slots in the user's local timezone by default, with the ability to optionally specify timezone.
For an event using Blind Availability Mode, a non-owner receives only the responses the caller is authorized to manage, while the Event Owner receives every response.

### Request Format

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
  requestId: "get-slots-123",
  payload: {
    type: "get-slots",
    timezone: "GMT" // Optional: IANA timezone name
  }
}
```

**Optional payload fields:**

- `timezone`: IANA timezone name (e.g., `"America/Los_Angeles"`, `"Asia/Kolkata"`).
  If not provided, uses `localStorage["timezone"].value` or browser's local timezone.

### Response Format

**Success response:**

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE",
  command: "get-slots",
  requestId: "get-slots-123",
  ok: true,
  payload: {
    slots: {
      "userId1": {
        name: "John Doe",
        email: "john@example.com",
        availability: ["2026-01-07T09:00:00", "2026-01-07T09:15:00", ...],
        ifNeeded: ["2026-01-07T14:00:00", ...]
      },
      "guestName": {
        name: "guestName",  // Guest name as stored in localStorage
        email: "",  // May be empty for guests
        availability: [...],
        ifNeeded: [...]
      }
    },
    timeIncrement: 15  // Time increment in minutes (15, 30, or 60)
  }
}
```

**Error response:**

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE",
  command: "get-slots",
  requestId: "get-slots-123",
  ok: false,
  error: {
    message: "Error message here"
  }
}
```

### Example Request

```javascript
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "test-get-slots-" + Date.now(),
    payload: {
      type: "get-slots",
    },
  },
  "*",
)
```

### Timezone Conversion

- Slots are stored in UTC in the backend
- `get-slots` converts UTC timestamps to the user's local timezone before returning
- Timezone is determined by (in priority order):
  1. `localStorage["timezone"].value` (if set)
  2. Browser's local timezone (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`)
- Returned timestamps are in ISO format without timezone (e.g., `"2026-01-07T09:00:00"`)

## set-slots

### Description

Sets availability slots for the current user (logged-in user or guest).
Converts timestamps from the user's timezone to UTC before storing in the backend.
**Completely overwrites** existing availability (does not merge with previous slots).
For an event using Blind Availability Mode, a non-owner can create and manage only the responses owned by the caller's Event Visitor Identity or associated with the caller's signed-in account: a `guestName` that matches a manageable response edits that response, and any other `guestName` creates a new response without changing the request shape.

### Request Format

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
  requestId: "set-slots-123",
  payload: {
    type: "set-slots",
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",  // Optional: IANA timezone name
    guestName: "John Doe",  // Required for guests if not in localStorage
    guestEmail: "john@example.com",  // Required if event.collectEmails is true
    slots: [
      {
        start: "2026-01-07T09:00:00",  // ISO format without timezone
        end: "2026-01-07T12:00:00",
        status: "available" | "if-needed"
      },
      {
        start: "2026-01-07T14:00:00",
        end: "2026-01-07T16:00:00",
        status: "if-needed"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Required payload fields:**

- `slots`: Array of slot objects, each with:
  - `start`: Start time (ISO string without timezone)
  - `end`: End time (ISO string without timezone)
  - `status`: Either `"available"` or `"if-needed"`

**Conditionally required payload fields:**

- `guestName`:
  - If provided, **forces guest mode** regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
    This allows logged-in users to set availability for guests.
  - Required for guests who aren't logged in and haven't set their name through the UI.
  - When provided, it will be stored in `localStorage[eventId + ".guestName"]` for future calls.
  - Can be used to edit an existing guest's availability (if that guest name already exists) or add a new guest (if it doesn't exist).
- `guestEmail`: Required if `event.collectEmails` is `true` and `guestName` is provided in the payload.
  Must be a valid email format.

**Optional payload fields:**

- `timezone`: IANA timezone name (e.g., `"America/Los_Angeles"`, `"Asia/Kolkata"`).
  If not provided, uses `localStorage["timezone"].value` or browser's local timezone.

### Response Format

**Success response:**

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE",
  command: "set-slots",
  requestId: "set-slots-123",
  ok: true
}
```

**Error response:**

```javascript
{
  type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE",
  command: "set-slots",
  requestId: "set-slots-123",
  ok: false,
  error: {
    message: "Error message here"
  }
}
```

### Example Request

**Basic request (logged-in user or guest with name in localStorage):**

```javascript
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "test-set-slots-" + Date.now(),
    payload: {
      type: "set-slots",
      timezone: "Asia/Kolkata", // IST
      slots: [
        {
          start: "2026-01-07T09:00:00",
          end: "2026-01-07T12:00:00",
          status: "available",
        },
        {
          start: "2026-01-07T12:00:00",
          end: "2026-01-07T16:00:00",
          status: "if-needed",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  "*",
)
```

**Request with guestName (forces guest mode, works even if logged in):**

```javascript
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "test-set-slots-" + Date.now(),
    payload: {
      type: "set-slots",
      timezone: "Asia/Kolkata",
      guestName: "John Doe", // Forces guest mode, can edit existing guest or add new one
      guestEmail: "john@example.com", // Required if event.collectEmails is true
      slots: [
        {
          start: "2026-01-07T09:00:00",
          end: "2026-01-07T12:00:00",
          status: "available",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  "*",
)
```

### Timezone Conversion

- Input timestamps are assumed to be in the specified timezone (or user's local timezone if not specified)
- `set-slots` converts these timestamps to UTC before sending to the backend
- **Timezone precedence order:**
  1. `payload.timezone` (if provided in the request) - **highest priority**
  2. `localStorage["timezone"].value` (if set)
  3. Browser's local timezone (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`) - **fallback**

### Interval Splitting

- Each `start`-`end` interval in the `slots` array is automatically split into smaller segments based on the event's `timeIncrement` (15, 30, or 60 minutes)
- For example, if `timeIncrement` is 15 minutes and you provide `{ start: "2026-01-07T09:00:00", end: "2026-01-07T10:00:00", status: "available" }`, this will generate timestamps at: 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45 (the end time is exclusive)
- The generated timestamps are what get sent to the backend

### Overlapping Intervals

- If you provide overlapping intervals in the `slots` array with the **same status**, all timestamps from all intervals will be included
- For example, if you provide:
  - `{ start: "09:00", end: "10:00", status: "available" }`
  - `{ start: "09:30", end: "10:30", status: "available" }`
- Both intervals will add their timestamps, resulting in: 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45, 10:00, 10:15 (assuming 15-minute increments)
- **Important:** If overlapping intervals have **different statuses**, an error will be thrown.
  For example:
  - `{ start: "09:00", end: "10:00", status: "available" }`
  - `{ start: "09:30", end: "10:30", status: "if-needed" }`
- This will result in an error: `"Conflicting status for timestamp [timestamp]: already marked as 'available' but also marked as 'if-needed'. Overlapping intervals must have the same status."`
-

### DOW (Days of Week) Events

For events with type `"dow"` (days of week), you **must** use specific hardcoded dates for the date part of your timestamps:

```javascript
export const dayIndexToDayString = Object.freeze([
  "2018-06-17", // Sunday
  "2018-06-18", // Monday
  "2018-06-19", // Tuesday
  "2018-06-20", // Wednesday
  "2018-06-21", // Thursday
  "2018-06-22", // Friday
  "2018-06-23", // Saturday
  "2018-06-24", // Sunday
])
```

**Example:** If you want to set availability for Monday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, you must use:

```javascript
{
  start: "2018-06-18T09:00:00",  // Monday
  end: "2018-06-18T12:00:00",
  status: "available"
}
```

The date part (`2018-06-18`) represents Monday, regardless of what the actual current date is.
The time part is what matters for scheduling.

### Non-Consecutive Event Dates

- If an event has non-consecutive dates (e.g., Jan 5th and Jan 7th, but not Jan 6th), and you provide a slot that spans across them (e.g., 8pm Jan 5th to 8pm Jan 7th):
  - The slot will **not** include timestamps for the invalid dates (Jan 6th)
  - Timestamps will be generated up to the end of the first valid date (Jan 5th)
  - Timestamps will resume at the start of the next valid date (Jan 7th)
  - Only timestamps that fall within valid event dates and time ranges are included
  - **No error will be thrown** - the system automatically filters out invalid dates

### Validation

- Validates that all slots fall within the event's date/time range
- Validates that `start` < `end` for each slot
- Validates that `status` is either `"available"` or `"if-needed"`
- **Overlapping intervals with different statuses**: If overlapping intervals have conflicting statuses (one "available", one "if-needed"), an error will be thrown: `"Conflicting status for timestamp [timestamp]: already marked as '[status1]' but also marked as '[status2]'. Overlapping intervals must have the same status."`
- For **DOW (days of week) events**: Validates that the date part of `start` and `end` timestamps match one of the hardcoded day dates listed above
- For **guests**:
  - If `guestName` is provided in payload, it forces guest mode and stores the name in localStorage
  - If `guestName` is not provided, validates that guest name exists in localStorage or requires it from payload
- For **guests with email collection**: Validates that `guestEmail` is provided (when `guestName` is in payload) and is a valid email format
- Returns appropriate error messages if validation fails

### Limitations

- **Group events are not supported** - returns an error if the event type is GROUP
- **Guest mode via payload** - If you provide `guestName` in the payload, the request will be processed as a guest regardless of whether you're logged in.
  This allows logged-in users to set availability for any guest (existing or new).
- **Guest name required** - For guests who haven't logged in and haven't provided `guestName` in the payload, the guest name must either:
  - Already exist in `localStorage[eventId + ".guestName"]` (set through the UI), OR
  - Be provided in the `guestName` field of the payload
- **Complete overwrite** - The slots you send in **completely clear out** any old slots and write these new ones in.
  This is not a merge operation.

## Testing

Use the browser console to test (don't forget to add listeners to intercept error/success messages):

**Get slots:**

```javascript
// Add listener first
window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  if (
    e.data?.type === "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE" &&
    e.data?.command === "get-slots"
  ) {
    if (e.data.ok) {
      console.log("Success:", e.data.payload)
    } else {
      console.error("Error:", e.data.error)
    }
  }
})

// Then send request
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "test-" + Date.now(),
    payload: { type: "get-slots" },
  },
  "*",
)
```

**Set slots:**

```javascript
// Add listener first
window.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
  if (
    e.data?.type === "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT_RESPONSE" &&
    e.data?.command === "set-slots"
  ) {
    if (e.data.ok) {
      console.log("Success: Slots updated")
    } else {
      console.error("Error:", e.data.error)
    }
  }
})

// Then send request
window.postMessage(
  {
    type: "FILL_CALENDAR_EVENT",
    requestId: "test-" + Date.now(),
    payload: {
      type: "set-slots",
      timezone: "Asia/Kolkata",
      guestName: "Test User", // Optional: forces guest mode if provided (works even if logged in)
      slots: [
        {
          start: "2026-01-07T09:00:00",
          end: "2026-01-07T12:00:00",
          status: "available",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
  "*",
)
```
