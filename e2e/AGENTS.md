# E2E Authoring and Debugging

Rules for the self-contained browser E2E package at the repository root `e2e/`.
Run its npm commands from the package directory.
Specs live in `e2e/specs/`; `playwright.config.ts`, `isolated-test-stack.ts`, `config/`, `helpers/`, and `inspect/` stay at the package root.
Firefox desktop is the canonical local verification project for the timed-event suite, and the recorded access-transfer journeys run there.
Project selection follows each project's `testMatch`: `timed-event-*firefox.spec.ts` runs under `firefox-desktop`, the touch spec runs under `firefox-touch`, and the remaining specs run under the Chromium projects.

## Failure Diagnosis Loop

- Run a failing test in isolation before changing anything, using the project that matches the spec: `npm run test:e2e -- --project=firefox-desktop -g "<test title>"` for a `timed-event-*firefox` spec, or `--project=chromium-desktop` for a Chromium spec.
- For bug fixes, this isolated failing run is the regression check; record fail-before and pass-after evidence as required by the Bug Fix Protocol in `../AGENTS.md`.
- Never pipe a run through `tail` or `head`: it hides progress until the run ends and can mask the suite's exit status.
  Run the command with full output streaming, and when a persistent log is needed, append `2>&1 | tee /tmp/opencode/<name>.log` instead of truncating.
- Read the full error output first; Playwright prints the action call log with the waiting locator, the resolved element, and the retry attempts.
- Each run writes artifacts to its own `/tmp/opencode/timeful-e2e-artifacts/<run-id>/` directory; run directories are never cleaned automatically, so every run stays independently inspectable.
- Find the latest run with `ls -t /tmp/opencode/timeful-e2e-artifacts | head -1`, set `E2E_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to relocate the artifacts root, and remove old run directories manually when no longer needed.
- Open the failure trace with `npx playwright show-trace <run-dir>/<spec-name>-<test-title>/trace.zip`; config retains traces for every failed test, including local runs with zero retries.
- Failed tests also save a page-snapshot error context (`error-context.md`), a failure screenshot, and a video in the same result directory; use them when the trace alone does not explain the failure.
- `error-context.md` is written for every failed test that finishes normally, including hook failures and failures after the page closed; only a worker crash or an interrupted run can omit it.
- Diagnose why the element was missing, hidden, ambiguous, or non-actionable; do not fix a timeout by adding a fixed sleep or by raising timeouts blindly.
- Re-run the isolated test after each fix; widen back to the full project only once it passes.
- Use `npm run test:e2e -- --ui` for interactive step-by-step debugging and `DEBUG=pw:api` for protocol-level verbose logging.
- Use `E2E_VIDEO=on npm run test:e2e -- --trace=on <selection>` to retain videos and traces for successful slow tests as well as failures.
  By default, both are retained only on failure.
- Multi-session specs should import `test` from `helpers/actor-context.ts` and use `actorContext("target")` to create isolated contexts with video lifecycle management.
  Direct `browser.newContext()` calls appear in traces but do not automatically record videos through Playwright Test's `video` option.
  The fixture attaches videos named by actor and page, including pages closed before the test ends, and deletes recordings for successful tests under the default retention policy.
  In the access-transfer spec, `video.webm` is the source page, `video-2-target-1.webm` is the target, and `video-3-stranger-1.webm` is the other browser; the API-only context creates no video.

## Authoring Rules

- Use user-facing locators: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`, and `getByTestId`; add a `data-testid` in app code when no accessible role exists.
- ESLint forbids `page.$`, `page.$$`, `page.pause`, `page.waitForSelector`, and raw `page.waitForTimeout` in this package.
- Assert with web-first expectations such as `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `toHaveCount()`, and `toContainText()`; they auto-retry, so never hand-roll polling.
- Use `expect(locator).toHaveCount()` when ambiguity is possible; strict mode fails loudly on multiple matches instead of acting on the wrong element.
- Pass an explicit timeout only with a reason; the default action timeout is 15 seconds and the default expect timeout is 5 seconds.
- Keep one behavior per test, and wrap long journeys in `test.step()` so traces and errors name the failing step.
- Seed state through the API instead of long UI setup journeys; reuse `./helpers` builders such as `seedCanonicalTimedEvent`.
- For API-seeded browser owner journeys, pass `page.request` or `page.context().request` to the seed helper before opening the event.
  These request contexts share the browser's cookie jar, including the HttpOnly creation cookies that prove [Event Owner](../docs/terminology/glossary.md#event-owner) authority.
  The standalone Playwright `request` fixture has its own cookie jar, so an event created through it leaves the page without creation credentials.
  Keep separate request or browser contexts for visitor and authorization-denial journeys; do not substitute visitor credentials for owner authority or bypass the edit control.
- Treat fixed settle delays as exceptions; use `settlePage` from `./helpers/settle` only when no state-based wait can express the condition, for example settling a CSS transition after resize.

## Environment

- Run `npm ci` in this package and in `../frontend` before the first run; the Playwright webServer starts the frontend Vite dev server from `../frontend`, so frontend dependencies must be installed too.
- `npm run test:e2e` owns the isolated test stack (`postgres-test`, `postgres-test-bootstrap`, and `server-test` on 3003) and Vite on 4174; never target the development API on 3002.
- The isolated stack includes a test-only `calendar-mock` provider that `server-test` reaches through `TEST_`-prefixed endpoint overrides set only in `compose.test.yaml`.
  Calendar journeys must never make live provider calls, and these overrides must never be enabled in production or staging.
  See [test-only calendar provider overrides](../docs/environments.md#test-only-calendar-provider-overrides).
- See `../frontend/AGENTS.md` for required frontend checks and `./inspect/AGENTS.md` for `npm run inspect` diagnostics.

### Fast local runs

- Local runs default to two workers.
  Use `--workers=4` to try more concurrency or `--workers=1` for sequential diagnosis; Firefox has no additional project-level cap.
  Existing serial test groups still run their own tests in order.
- E2E CI runs the Chromium, Firefox desktop, and Firefox touch suites as three parallel matrix jobs, each on its own runner with its own isolated test stack.
  Chromium and Firefox desktop run at two workers; Firefox touch stays at one worker because it matches a single serial spec file.
  The Firefox desktop job sets `E2E_FRONTEND=bundled` so the recorded access-transfer journeys stay within budget at two workers, while the other suites keep the default dev-server frontend.
  The Chromium job is the only matrix job that saves the shared Nix, Go, npm, and migrator-image caches, so concurrent same-key saves cannot race.
- Run a focused spec with `npm run test:e2e -- --project=firefox-desktop specs/timed-event-reprojection-firefox.spec.ts`, or select a title with `-g "<test title>"`.
- Ordinary projects start Vite without a production build.
  Production-style checks live in `styling-production.spec.ts` and run in `chromium-production-desktop` and `chromium-production-mobile`, which share the `production-assets` build dependency.
- Run `npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium-production-desktop --project=chromium-production-mobile` for production-asset verification.
  Do not use `--no-deps`: the dependency builds fresh assets before the checks.
- Run `npm run test:e2e` for all projects, including the production build and checks.
  Supported events are created by default; no creation flag is required.
- Keep parallelism inside a single Playwright invocation; concurrent invocations conflict over the fixed test-stack project and ports.
  The stack prints setup and teardown durations so infrastructure overhead can be distinguished from test execution.
- The Firefox desktop plus touch benchmark passed at one and two workers, reducing wall time from 337s to 239s at two workers; four workers caused timeouts and was rejected.
- Access-transfer coverage is heavier: each recorded transfer journey opens and records up to three isolated pages and runs with an explicit 40-second per-test budget, while the cancel and expired-link checks keep Playwright's 30-second default.
- Set `E2E_FRONTEND=bundled` to make the webServer build a fresh test-mode frontend and serve it from a Playwright-owned preview on the isolated host, port, and proxy, with assets under the invocation artifact directory.
  Bundled mode is opt-in and does not replace the production-asset projects; the dev server remains the default.
  On the benchmark machine, all eight access-transfer tests pass at the default two workers with `E2E_FRONTEND=bundled E2E_VIDEO=on`, and the first four pass repeatedly.
- Use `npm run test:e2e -- --project=firefox-desktop --workers=1 specs/timed-event-access-transfer-firefox.spec.ts` as the sequential fallback when bundled mode is unavailable.
